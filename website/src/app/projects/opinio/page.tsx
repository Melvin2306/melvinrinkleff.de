      <p> Opinio is a platform for employees to give feedback to the software development team of internal developed software tools. The software development team can then use this feedback to improve the software tools. The tool can be easily implemented in the internal software tool and provides different insights in how the employees use the internal software, current bugs, trends in the joy of using the software and much more. </p>
      <p> In a group of three, we worked on this project as part of our studies at 
        <a href="https://code.berlin">CODE University of Applied Sciences</a>
        I worked as a Full Stack Developer on different parts of the application.
      </p>
      <p> The project is still live as of now and can be visited and used here: 
        <a href="https://app.getopinio.com/">Opinio Web Application</a>
